Check this awesome project out! I tested it with my worlds and they all load in perfectly!

# Eye of Ocram

A failed attempt at making a Terraria world parser (and hopefully viewer; specifically made for Xbox 360 saves)... I could not understand how the tile data type was structured and lost interest pretty quickly. Happy someone did what I didn't do!

The latest title update (AKA TU) was roughly equal to 1.2.4.1 (haven't tested opening it in these versions on PC yet, but the source code is a good reference).
